# BnRelatiFreq
A project to study the relative frequency of letters in Bangla texts. I used 2 famous novels of Bangla Literature "Lalshalu" (Called "Tree Without Roots" in English) published in 1948 by Syed Waliullah and "Nondito Noroke" (Called "In Blissful Hell" in English) published in 1972 by Dr. Humayun Ahmed as dataset.
